This document tests various AsciiDoc features including *bold text*, _italic text_, and `monospace code`.

== Introduction

Welcome to this ^superscript^ and ~subscript~ text example. Here's a link:https://rust-lang.org[Rust Programming Language] that should be parsed correctly.

You can also use **double asterisks for bold** and __double underscores for emphasis__.

=== Code Examples

Here's some Rust code:

----
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, AsciiDoc!");
    let mut vec = Vec::new();
    vec.push(42);
}
----

And a simple example block:

====
This is an example block that contains important information.
It can span multiple lines and include formatting like *bold* text.
====

== Lists and More

=== Unordered Lists

* First item with *bold* text
* Second item with a link:https://github.com[GitHub link]
** Nested item with `code`
** Another nested item

=== Ordered Lists

. First numbered item
. Second numbered item with _emphasis_
.. Sub-item with **strong** text
.. Another sub-item

=== Description Lists

CPU:: The central processing unit
RAM:: Random access memory with `volatile` storage
SSD:: Solid state drive for fast link:https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_storage[data storage]

== Advanced Features

.Important Note
[NOTE]
====
This is a note block that provides additional information.

Here's a line break: +
This text appears on a new line.

== Conclusion

This document demonstrates various AsciiDoc features that our parser should handle gracefully. Some features like *formatting*, links, and basic blocks should work, while others may need additional implementation.
